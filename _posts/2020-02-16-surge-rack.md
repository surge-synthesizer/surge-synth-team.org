[Surge for VCV Rack](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/rack_manual) takes the Surge synthesizer and delivers it as a collection 
of modules for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com). The modules expose our oscillators, effects, some of our filters, and our modulators.

You can read the entire manual at the link above, and can download the VCV Rack modules by adding Surge for Rack to your VCV Library the way
you would any other free and open source modules.
