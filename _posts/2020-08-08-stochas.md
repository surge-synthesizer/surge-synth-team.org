## Features
- Cross-platform MIDI sequencer surfaced as a VST/AU/etc. plugin

- Adjust randomness of note start times for more humanized playback
- Adjust randomness of note velocity and length
- Fully MIDI-programmable interface for live performance. Mute/unmute layers, change patterns, time signature, etc. on the fly via MIDI

- Adjust note start time to move sequence "off the grid", as well as note length
- Record incoming MIDI to grid

- Create up to 8 patterns

## History
Stochas was originally developed as closed source software back in 2016 and was made available for sale by Audio Vitamins. The original idea sprang from a JSFX plugin (Reaper plugin) created by Andrew Shakinovsky called Stochasticizer which allowed semi-random sequencing of melodic and drum lines. Andrew was contacted by Dave Clissold of Audio Vitamins who suggested creating a plugin that would work in any DAW. The two worked together to design the product which was released a few months later. Due to lack of time to devote to marketing a commercial product, in 2020 it was decided to release the software as open source in the hope that it would be useful to music producers around the world.
