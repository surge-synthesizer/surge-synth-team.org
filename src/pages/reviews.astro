        <p>
            We sometimes see reviews and guides of the projects we work on, and
            we have decided to collect them here. These aren't the official
            manuals or tutorials that we have made! You can find those on the
            project page for each project.
        </p>

            If you have a review, video tutorial, blog series, or some other
            media that tells folks about a Surge Synth Team project, we would
            love to feature it here! Open an issue or submit a pull request on
            the
            <Link

                text="surge-synth-team.org"
            /> repository. As long as it falls in line with our principles of
            respect and decency to all, we will add it.
