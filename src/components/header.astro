        The Surge Synth Team is a group of musicians, developers, testers, documenters, and general
        volunteer open source enthusiasts who randomly assembled to work on the Surge Synthesizer.
        As the Surge project became more successful, and we kept having fun, we decided to branch
        out into other things too!
