We sometimes see reviews and guides of the projects we work on, and we have decided to collect
them here. These aren't the official manuals or tutorials that we have made! You can find those
on the project page for each project.

If you have a review, video tutorial, blog series, or some other media that tells folks about a
Surge Synth Team project, we would love to feature it here! Open an issue or submit a pull request on the
[surge-synth-team.org](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-synth-team.org) repository.
As long as it falls in line with our principles of respect and decency to all, we will add it.
