What? Shortcircuit is open source? Well yes, but there are some big caveats. Right now, we are in the middle of rebuilding Shortcircuit from a (very generously) open sourced copy of the SC2 codebase. That codebase was old, ran only on Windows, etc... so we are in the middle of a rebuild.

In early 2022 with Surge XT 1.0 out the door, we turned to Shortcircuit. Right no,w we have a super-pre-alpha version with an incomplete GUI and a not very well-tested engine. But it does make sounds, and not just on Windows!
