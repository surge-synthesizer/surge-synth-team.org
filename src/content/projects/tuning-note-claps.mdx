The Surge Synth Team tuning-note-claps is a CLAP format plugin that contains two separate devices — EDN-M To Note Expression and MTS-ESP To Note Expression — which can be used to microtune the integrated instrument devices included with Bitwig Studio using CLAP note expressions.

**EDN-N To Note Expression** can be used to tune the Bitwig instruments to a large range of equal-temperaments.

**MTS-ESP To Note Expression** Connects with MTS-ESP, and retunes incoming MIDI notes accordingly. This effectively makes the entire suite of Bitwig Studio devices compatible with MTS-ESP. For more info on what MTS-ESP is and how to use it, check this section of our [Tuning Guide](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/tuning-guide/#mts-esp)

Big thanks to the Bitwig Studio and ODDsound developers, without whose efforts this wouldn't be possible.
