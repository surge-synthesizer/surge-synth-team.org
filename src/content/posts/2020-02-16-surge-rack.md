[Surge XT for VCV Rack](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/rack_xt_manual) takes the Surge XT synthesizer and delivers it as a collection 
of modules for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com). The modules expose our oscillators, effects, filters, and more.

You can read the entire manual at the link above, and can download the VCV Rack modules by adding "Surge XT for Rack" to your VCV Library the way
you would any other free and open source module collections.
