Dexed is an amazing free synth, reliably one of the most popular open source synthesizers. It models the Yamaha DX-7 incredibly well and
provides those great FM sounds.

We maintain a fork which at times runs a bit ahead of the main Dexed. _As of this writing, our branch is even with
or behind the main Dexed branch_.

Some features we have added to Dexed include:

-   Microtuning support
-   MPE Support
-   Automated builds and more modern build infrastructure
-   Some UI improvements

Since our branch is now even with or behind the main branch of Dexed, the best place to try our changes
is by [Grabbing the nightly build from asb2m10's github](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/releases/tag/Nightly).

But if you want, you can always see the [code for our Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/dexed.git)
